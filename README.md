# Full Stack WebApplication

This project aims to understand how the **Java2EE** architecture works and how to develop fantastic applications **using Java**.


## 🚀 - Technologies
For this project I used/will use the following **technologies and/or methodologies**:

- [x] Java (as base language, for front and backend);
- [x] JSP (to make the front-end pages);
- [x] Servlet (to make the back-end API, using RESTFul pattern);
- [x] JPA/Hibernate (to more productively);
- [x] CSS (to front-end styles).

## ❓ - How can I remotely access the pages that have been deployed?
You must be wondering:

- _"How can I remotely access the pages that have been deployed?"_

And, if you are not an expert in GitHub/deployments (WHAT THERE IS NOT THE SAME PROBLEM), you can access it using the following "context path": `https://matheus-fsantos.github.io/webapp/src/index`.

## ☀️ - To Finish
Regarding version **1.0.0-SNAPSHOT** i only have this to present to you, **in future versions I will add more information and functionalities**, it is very likely that **in version 2.0.0 this design will drastically change** lol, however, everything will always be documented.

Below is some information about the current version of the project, and see you later!
